This code is built in Delphi 7 and is based on the the Legend of Mir 2 emulater.

Our plan is to strip out the Mir propriotry code leaving an open source MMORPG client and server.

First tasks are to remove all copyrighted graphics content and enable normal file formats instead of the customised .wil that is currently in use.
